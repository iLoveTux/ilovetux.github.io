Hobbiest turned developer, I love the idea of Open Sorce. I'd even go so far as to say it's probably the most important idea thought of in history.

### More Information

I've had a hard go at life early on being angry, frustrated and mis-directed I made some mistakes, but I'm making up for it now. I have a family of 5, a stable job and a sense of purpose all of which allow me to go through my days with a smile on my face.
